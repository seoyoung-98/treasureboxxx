                    When I was young, <br>
                    I had a birthday party at school, and I wore this tiara and had a birthday party. <br>
                    The memory of playing with my friends wearing this tiara is so precious that this tiara is precious to me.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </h1>

                <p>There is no reader who can't understand the rather poetic expression of "an unfaded memory stained with emotion." <br>
                    This is because our lives naturally let us know that very sad or very happy things remain as memories for a long time.</p>
