                    I have been with this Polaroid camera since I was young. <br>
                    Polaroid cameras have captured every important moment of growing up. <br>
                    Pictures of these memories will be a big fortune to me later on. <br>
                    irreplaceable to anything else.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </h1>

                <p>Although the photo is instantiated, I personally think the value of the photo is still valid.<br>
                    I think the value of pictures is 'memory'.<br>
                    It may be a lame story, but it used to be and I think it's the same now.<br>
                    You have to take a nice picture and post it on Instagram to complete the picture, but the composition is sloppy, <br>
                    and even if the expression is weird, the picture is worth a lot as a memory.
                </p>
