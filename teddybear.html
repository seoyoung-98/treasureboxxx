                    When I was young, I got a teddy bear as a birthday gift from my dad.<br>
                    After that, 
                    I naturally started to like teddy bears and still have a hobby of collecting teddy bears.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </h1>

                <p>
                    The teddy bear is a toy that has long been loved by children in their childhood. <br>
                    The teddy bear, made of soft cloth and a ball of fur, was the children's dragonfly friend and dreamland companion. <br>
                    In Korea, teddy bears were called "Winnie the Bear dolls were called "Winnie." With no other bear doll brand, <br>
                    the teddy bear has become a representative childhood toy under the name "Bear". <br>
                    Then in the early 90s, a new name for a teddy bear appears.<br>
                    It's Teddy Bear.<br>
